# Project Setup 

## Database Setup

In your mongosh, run these commands:

```sh
use learn # the database
db.createCollection("comedians") # the collections
db.createCollection("shows") 
db.createCollection("rates")
db.createCollection("payrolls")
```

## Quick Start

```sh
npm i
npm run clear # clear database (use when needed)
npm run seed # seed data (Comedian, Show, Rates)
npm start
```

> This application will exit after execution.

## Lesson (26 Nov 2022)

By the end of this lesson, we would have these APIs:

|#|Url|Verb|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|/comedians|POST|Create a document `comedian` with an object in request body|
|2|/comedians|GET|List all comedians|
|3|/shows|POST|Create a document `show` with an object in request body|
|4|/shows|GET|List all shows|
|5|/shows/:id|PUT|Modify a document `show`. Can be used to add `comedian(s)` as `performers` in a show.|
|6|/shows/:id|DELETE|Delete a document `show`. 

Show Collection:
|Field|Type|
|-|-|
|title|String|
|venue|String|
|start|Date|
|duration|NumberInt|
|performers|String[]|

Sample data of `Show` model:

```json
{
    "title":"Funny Night",
    "venue":"Esplanade",
    "start":"2022-12-30T11:00:00Z", // 8PM in UTC
    "duration":90, // in minutes
    "performers":[
        {
            "name":"Ra Ra Kumar",
            "location":"Singapore"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Endpoints:

|#|Url|Verb|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|/assign/:showId/:comedianId|POST|It should assign a comedian to a show. Check for duplicate. Check if comedian exist.|
|2|/assign/:showId/:comedianId|PUT|It should remove the specified comedian out of the show. Check if comedian does exist as performers.|
|3|/generatepayroll/:month/:year|POST|Create document(s) in the `PayRoll` collection. Check against `Rates` to determine how much salary a comedian is going to get for the month/year. Filter `Show` collection based on the `start` date. This endpoint is assumed to be called on the first day of the month.|

Consider returning these statuses:

|Status Code | Reason|
|-|-|
|200 ok|general success status. read, update or delete success should return this.|
|201 created|create success should return this|
|400 bad request|return when inputs are insufficient or wrong|
|409 conflict|return this status when there is a conflict. such as a failed update operation|
|500 internal server error | return this for any unexpected error|
